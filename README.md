# ghetto_home_security

Code for a simple home security device that can be built with a HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and a sparkio board.

1)
Currently you will have to host the server the device will ping, somewhere. Heroku should be fine.

2)
Throw the code into your sparkio ide. 
  You'll have to change the ip/port/path of the server to your own.
  Then change the distance you want the sensor to go off with.



TODO:
  Smartphone app to arm the device.
  Breadboard graph.
  Script that autmatically pushes to the board.
